# AlexNet-VGG16-CNN-analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive comparative analysis of convolutional neural network architectures, specifically focusing on AlexNet and VGG16. The project explores the impact of various data augmentation techniques (rotation, flipping, scaling) on model performance and conducts hyperparameter tuning to optimize the training process. Additionally, the project utilizes both custom CNN implementations and transfer learning approaches to evaluate the models on a hand gesture recognition dataset.

Key Features:
Implementation and evaluation of AlexNet and VGG16 models.
Application of data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
Comparative analysis using metrics like training accuracy, validation accuracy, and loss.
Hyperparameter tuning to identify optimal configurations.
Visualization of training and validation results.
